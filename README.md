# Python Object-Oriented Programming Contents & Exercises
* Defining classes
* Checking instance types
* Using multiple inheritance (e.g. an object of class Human also IS of class Mammal)
* Creating objects with composition (e.g. an object belonging to class Library HAS objects belonging to class Book)
* Leveraging magic methods (e.g. __str__(), __repr__(), __equals__(), ...)
* Calling objects like functions (e.g. for class instance objects with frequently changing contents)
* Defining data classes (e.g. for simpler, shorter compositions)
* Creating immutable data classes
